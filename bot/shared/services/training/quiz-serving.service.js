/**
 * Teacher Training — quiz SERVING policy (pure decision layer).
 *
 * WHAT IT DECIDES
 * ---------------
 *   1. Which questions an attempt is served (module quizzes: one per Bloom
 *      level; level exams: a random cap).
 *   2. In what order that question's options are displayed.
 *
 * Both were "all of them, in order_index order" before. The change exists
 * because the imported banks are far bigger than a WhatsApp quiz should be —
 * a module check ran to a median of 9 questions and a level exam to 72 — and
 * because a re-sit presented the identical paper with the identical lettering.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SEPARATE, PURE MODULE
 * ---------------------------------
 * quiz-delivery.service is a high-blast-radius file imported by the webhook
 * router, the Flow handler, the orchestrator, the certificate service and
 * content delivery. The serving RULES are the part most likely to be tuned
 * per vendor, so they live here as pure functions with no DB, no WhatsApp and
 * no config import — trivially testable, and impossible to break delivery by
 * editing. The DB lookup that feeds `config` in stays in quiz-delivery, next
 * to the vendor pass-mark lookups that already walk the same tree.
 *
 * WHY IT IS CONFIG-DRIVEN
 * -----------------------
 * The policy is per content vendor (`training_vendors`), not per country and
 * not hardcoded. One vendor's imported banks are Bloom-tagged and huge;
 * another's are short and already curated. Switching a second vendor onto the
 * same policy must be an UPDATE, not a deploy — so every knob here reads from
 * a vendor row and every default reproduces the behaviour that shipped before
 * this file existed.
 *
 * DETERMINISM IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
 * -------------------------------
 * The served set is stored NOWHERE — no column, no join table, only one
 * answer row per question actually answered. Three paths re-derive it
 * independently (send, button handler, resume). So every choice here is
 * seeded on ids that never change: the attempt id for question selection, and
 * (attempt id, question id) for option order. Same attempt ⇒ same paper, same
 * lettering, for as long as the row exists.
 *
 * CANONICAL INDICES
 * -----------------
 * `buildOptionDisplayOrder` returns CANONICAL 1-based option indices in
 * display order. The caller shows them as A/B/C… but must persist the
 * canonical index — that is what `correct_option` is expressed in, and what
 * 400k+ historical `training_assessment_answers` rows already hold. Shuffling
 * is a presentation concern and must never reach storage.

 * Which canonical option indices to display, in display order.

 *   N. Doing that BEFORE the permutation keeps the cut deterministic and

 *   would vary by attempt, which is a fairness problem, not a variety one.
 *
 *   ...but the plain "first N" cut can drop the answer. One imported question
 *   has 12 options; if its key pointed past the cap the question was
 *   unanswerable. So any option named by the key is swapped INTO the kept
 *   set, displacing the last kept option that is not itself part of the key.
 *   Multi-answer keys ('1,11,13') keep every member.
